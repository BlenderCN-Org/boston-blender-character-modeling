# Head Modeling Steps

Add a new plane. Rotate it 90 degrees on the X axis, size and move it to match about the height of the nose. Make sure to not move it on the X axis (X location should be zero).

Apply rotation and scale (all rotation values should be 0, all scale values 1).

Add a mirror modifier, check the **Clipping** option.

---

In **Edit Mode** move the face over the screen right eye (this will create another face on the left).

![head04](images/head/head04.jpg)

---

Add four loop cuts around the eye.

![head07](images/head/head07.jpg)

---

Do the same with the three vertices in the bottom right corner.

Line up this vertex to the jaw in front view.

**Checkpoint:** `e2_head12.blend`

![head12](images/head/head12.jpg)

---

Move the three side vertices back according to the side reference.

![head13](images/head/head13.jpg)

![head14](images/head/head14.jpg)

---

Select the two vertices to the right of the eye and move them back.

![head15](images/head/head15.jpg)

![head16](images/head/head16.jpg)

---

Extrude these two faces in. Use the scale tool if having issues with the extrusion tool.

![head17](images/head/head17.jpg)

![head18](images/head/head18.jpg)

---

Line up the new vertices to the mouth in both front and side view.

![head19](images/head/head19.jpg)

![head20](images/head/head20.jpg)

---

Delete the two faces over the mouth.

![head21](images/head/head21.jpg)

---

Select the edge loop around the lips (**alt+click**) and extrude them in. Line up the new vertices to the center of the mouth.

![head22](images/head/head22.jpg)

![head23](images/head/head23.jpg)

![head24](images/head/head24.jpg)

---

Add an edge loop around the mouth, just under the nose.

![head25](images/head/head25.jpg)

---

Add another edge loop around the mouth, just above the tip of the nose.

![head26](images/head/head26.jpg)

---

Smooth out the new loops by moving the vertices. Check in all views.

**Checkpoint:** `e2_head29.blend`

![head28](images/head/head28.jpg)

![head29](images/head/head29.jpg)

---

Add an edge loop through the left side of the eye...

![head30](images/head/head30.jpg)

... and another edge loop across the eye.

![head31](images/head/head31.jpg)

---

Select this vertex and delete it. This should create a hole for the eye.

![head32](images/head/head32.jpg)

![head33](images/head/head33.jpg)

---

Shape the edges around the eye and the edges running along the nose.

![head34](images/head/head34.jpg)

---

Select the edge loop around the eye and extrude it in twice.

![head35](images/head/head35.jpg)

![head36](images/head/head36.jpg)

![head37](images/head/head37.jpg)

---

Add another edge loop below the eye.

![head39](images/head/head39.jpg)

---

At this point it's useful to create eyeballs as a reference for adjusting the shape of the eyelids.

**Checkpoint:** `e2_head39.blend`

![head38](images/head/head38.jpg)

---

Select these two faces and extrude them forward for the nose.

![head40](images/head/head40.jpg)

![head41](images/head/head41.jpg)

---

Move the nose vertices to match the reference image in side view.

![head42](images/head/head42.jpg)

The front should look similar to this:

![head43](images/head/head43.jpg)

---

Add an edge loop through the tip of the nose. Shape the new loop so it's nice and smooth.

**Checkpoint:** `e2_head45.blend`

![head44](images/head/head44.jpg)

![head45](images/head/head45.jpg)

---

Add an edge loop from the tip of the mouth.

![head46](images/head/head46.jpg)

---

Add an edge loop to the jaw.

![head47](images/head/head47.jpg)

---

Adjust the new vertices so it looks something like this from the side:

![head48](images/head/head48.jpg)

---

Select these edges and extrude them back.

![head49](images/head/head49.jpg)

![head49a](images/head/head49a.jpg)

---

Merge these two vertices at their center center.

![head50](images/head/head50.jpg)

![head51](images/head/head51.jpg)

---

Make sure that the vertices at the top of the face are equally spaced horizontally.

Select these edges around the top of the face and extrude them up.

![head52](images/head/head52.jpg)

![head53](images/head/head53.jpg)

---

Adjust the new vertices so they make a straight-as-possible line in side view.

![head54](images/head/head54.jpg)

---

Extrude the top edge 7 times, rotating after each extrusion, to create the shape of the rest of the head.

![head55](images/head/head55.jpg)

---

Select these four vertices and fill them in (**shift-F**). Repeat the same for the next three faces.

![head57](images/head/head57.jpg)

---

Select these edges at the bottom of the jaw and extrude them back three times.

![head60](images/head/head60.jpg)

---

Merge these vertices at the bottom of the head.
